# monkeylang
**monkeylang** is a repository for an interpreter of a custom programming language as seen in Thorsten Ball's book "Writing an Interpreter in Go".

The code follows the book closely, but I intend to apply cleaner code practices if/when possible and implement other useful features that have been mentioned, but are out of the scope of this book. 

## Usage
Currently in progress, this code cannot be utilized, refer to test files for use cases.
